Get the pastry out and cut it into a rectangular shape or any shape you wish.
Then spread the melted chocolate on one side and fold it. Put as much chocolate as you want.
Cover the pastry in egg and spary some oil on the surface you are going to bake it in. Wait until the surface is Golden and a bit brown and then take it out.
